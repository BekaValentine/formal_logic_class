# Formal Logic Class

These notes are intended to accompany an informal class on formal logic held at Queerious Labs in early 2023. The notes will try to be a complete reference of what the class is about, hopefully enough to be usable by anyone who isn't physically at the class.

## Tentative Outline

1. What is logic for and how does it relate broadly-speaking to computation and programs?
2. Overviews of kinds of logics
3. Boolean logic and other value-oriented logics -- the tools in every computer geek's back pocket
4. Exploration of Proof Techniques and how they relate to different logics (by way of implementations, if so desired)
